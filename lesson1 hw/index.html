            Eleven was kidnapped as a newborn by Dr. Martin Brenner and raised in Hawkins National Laboratory, where she
            was experimented on for her inherited psychokinetic abilities. After escaping the lab, she was found by
            Mike, Lucas, and Dustin. Upon discovering her abilities, Mike believed that she could help find Will, their
            missing friend. During their time together, she and Mike formed a strong bond and quickly grew to like each
            other. It was ultimately revealed that, in a lab experiment, she made contact with a creature from another
            dimension, accidentally opening an interdimensional gateway. In an attempt to protect her friends, Eleven
            eventually faced and destroyed this monster in a showdown at Hawkins Middle School, mysteriously vanishing
            in the process.

            When Mike's best friend, Will Byers, mysteriously went missing, he and his other friends, Lucas and Dustin,
            made it their mission to find him. However, while searching for Will, they stumbled upon an escaped girl
            named Eleven instead. Mike soon discovered that she knew something about Will's disappearance and enlisted
            her help in finding him. During their time together, Mike and Eleven formed a strong bond and quickly grew
            to like each other. Once Will was found, Mike was happy that he had returned home safely; however, he was
            greatly devastated by Eleven's sacrifice to defeat the Demogorgon.
